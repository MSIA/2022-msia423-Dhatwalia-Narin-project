### Background

Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades, 
buying and selling shares of companies based in the U.S. and around the world.

At least 113 lawmakers have disclosed stock transactions that were made in 2021 by themselves or family members, according to a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures and MarketWatch reporting. U.S. lawmakers bought an estimated $180 million worth of stock last year and sold $175 million.

The trading action taking place in both the House and the Senate comes as some lawmakers push for a ban on congressional buying and selling of individual stocks. Stock trading is a bipartisan activity in Washington, widely conducted by both Democrats and Republicans, the disclosures show. Congress as a whole tended to be slightly bullish last year with more buys than sells as the S&P 500 SPX soared and returned 28.4%. Republicans traded a larger dollar amount overall — an estimated $201 million vs. Democrats’ $154 million.

Stock picking by elected officials gets worrisome because there is widespread concern that legislators may have access to insider information. It is also possible 
that their stock purchases will consciously or unconsciously impact policy making.

### Vision 

The aim of the project is to predict the profitability of stock investments made by members of U.S. Congress. The final goal is to build a model which can 
accurately determine whether an investment made by a U.S. lawmaker will be profitable in the future. Results from this model can benefit retail investors while picking their own 
stocks, as well as watchdog groups to explore possible cases of insider trading.

### Mission

A logistic regression model is leveraged for the purpose of classifying stock purchases as "profitable" vs. "non-profitable". A "profitable" investment is defined as a 
stock purchase by a Congress member where that specific company's stock is trading at a higher price today than the price on the date of transaction (i.e. when the Congress official purchased it).

Two APIs are used to source the data for this project. The "House Stock Watcher" API is used to extract Stock purchase transactions of Congress members (from 
documents filed under the Stock Act of 2012), and the "Yahoo Finance" API is used to obtain the prices at which different stocks were trading on a specific day.

Once the app is live, users can obtain a prediction ("profitable" or "non-profitable") along with the probability of the transaction being "profitable". This information can be vital
for retail investors who track financial disclosures made by Congress members, and wish to assess whether they should also purchase the same stock. Moreover, watchdog groups can possibly interpret a very high probability as a possible suggestion of insider trading. Note that users can also obtain a similar prediction and probability for all past transactions made by Congress members. 

Features to be input by users once the model is live:

* Name of Congress Official
* Ticker of the company they've invested in
* Dollar amount that has been invested
* Current price of the company's stock

### Success Criteria

The two success criteria for this project are as follows:

* The prediction accuracy and the AUC/ROC score of the binary classifier are concrete indicators of the model's predictive performance. 
Before the model goes live, the prediction accuracy should be above 0.70 and the AUC/ROC score should be above 0.85.

* Once the model goes live, it becomes important to measure user engagement. Therefore, the business outcomes of concern will be the number of predictions made per day, number of website visits per day, and the percentage of repeat visitors (i.e. users that return to the webpage within the same week).

## Running the app 

### 1. Initialize the database 
#### Build the image 

To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.run -t pennylanedb .
```
#### Create the database 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` run: 

```bash
docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/data,target=/app/data/ pennylanedb create_db  --engine_string=sqlite:///data/tracks.db
```
The `--mount` argument allows the app to access your local `data/` folder and save the SQLite database there so it is available after the Docker container finishes.


#### Adding songs 
To add songs to the database:

```bash
docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/data,target=/app/data/ pennylanedb ingest --engine_string=sqlite:///data/tracks.db --artist=Emancipator --title="Minor Cause" --album="Dusk to Dawn"
```

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2022-msia423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in dockerfiles/Dockerfile.app 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

#### Build the image 

To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.app -t pennylaneapp .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylaneapp`, based on the instructions in `dockerfiles/Dockerfile.app` and the files existing in this directory.

#### Running the app

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
 docker run --name test-app --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/data,target=/app/data/ -p 5000:5000 pennylaneapp
```
You should be able to access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser (Mac/Linux should also be able to access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000/) .

The arguments in the above command do the following: 

* The `--name test-app` argument names the container "test". This name can be used to kill the container once finished with it.
* The `--mount` argument allows the app to access your local `data/` folder so it can read from the SQLlite database created in the prior section. 
* The `-p 5000:5000` argument maps your computer's local port 5000 to the Docker container's port 5000 so that you can view the app in your browser. If your port 5000 is already being used for someone, you can use `-p 5001:5000` (or another value in place of 5001) which maps the Docker container's port 5000 to your local port 5001.

Note: If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `dockerfiles/Dockerfile.app`)


#### Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. If you named the container, you can execute the following: 

```bash
docker kill test-app 
```
where `test-app` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

If you did not name the container, you can look up its name by running the following:

```bash 
docker container ls
```

The name will be provided in the right most column. 

## Testing

Run the following:

```bash
 docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.test -t pennylanetest .
```

To run the tests, run: 

```bash
 docker run pennylanetest
```

The following command will be executed within the container to run the provided unit tests under `test/`:  

```bash
python -m pytest
``` 

## Mypy

Run the following:

```bash
 docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.mypy -t pennymypy .
```

To run mypy over all files in the repo, run: 

```bash
 docker run pennymypy .
```
To allow for quick iteration, mount your entire repo so changes in Python files are detected:


```bash
 docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/,target=/app/ pennymypy .
```

To run mypy for a single file, run: 

```bash
 docker run pennymypy run.py
```

## Pylint

Run the following:

```bash
 docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.pylint -t pennylint .
```

To run pylint for a file, run:

```bash
 docker run pennylint run.py 
```

(or any other file name, with its path relative to where you are executing the command from)

To allow for quick iteration, mount your entire repo so changes in Python files are detected:


```bash
 docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/,target=/app/ pennylint run.py
```
